                  <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Clay weight (density) <br>
                    It is measured in units of pounds / gallons, gm / cm 3, pounds / foot 3, as well as pounds /
                    inch 1000 feet (pressure gradient). The device that measures density is called a mud
                    balance (MUD BALANCE).

                  <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> The apparent viscosity (MARSH FUNNEL VISCOSITY), which is the time in seconds
                    required to fill a volume of (946 cm 3) through the Marsh funnel, measured in seconds
                    (SECOND). <br>
                  <em><strong>Note:</strong> The measured viscosity of water is 26 sec.</em>

                    It is meant by the amount of water (cm3) filtered through a porous paper (FILTER
                    PAPER) after applying pressure on a clay sample of (100) Pa/Ing 2 in a period of (30)
                    minutes. The examination is carried out by means of the filter press, as well as by
                    measuring the thickness of the mud cake in millimeters.
                    <em><strong>Note:</strong> The filter is measured within (7.5) minutes, and the result is multiplied by (2).</em>

                  <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>FBasal PH <br>
                    It is measured using paper that changes color according to (PH). There is also an electric
                    device. <br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Water is a neutral solution (i.e. not bottomless or acidic) and its PH is equal to (7),
                        as for basic solutions it is between (8-14) and for acidic solutions it is between 1-6</li>

                        <li>The mud is alkaline because all the chemicals used do not undergo a chemical
                          reaction unless the surroundings are alkaline. Therefore, before starting the
                          threading operations, caustic soda is added to make the surroundings alkaline.</li>
